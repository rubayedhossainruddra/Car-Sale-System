Car Sale Management System

A Java Swing-based desktop application designed to manage the sale of cars efficiently.
The system includes different user roles — Admin, Staff (Salesman), and User — each with their own functionalities.
Data is stored using JSON, making it simple, file-based, and ideal for educational and learning purposes.

All car and transaction data stored in JSON format

Data auto-updates when actions occur (e.g., booking, purchase, or car status change)
